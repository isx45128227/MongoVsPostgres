# Final project ASIX Course 2017-2018
## RDBMS vs NoSQL by Roger Ferran Aranguren  

  Welcome to my project!
  
  This project is about Postgres and MongoDB speed comparison.
  
  If you want to know more about Postgres and MongoDB I encourage you to
  start reading the [documentation](https://github.com/isx45128227/MongoVsPostgres/blob/master/documentacio.md#project-documentation)
  I have prepared in order to explain every detail of the procees I have followed
  to compare it.
  
  You can also install both interfaces using the documentation or utilize
  dockers I have made. You can use them to test queries following the [structure
  explained](https://github.com/isx45128227/MongoVsPostgres/blob/master/documentacio.md#docker-interface)
  in the documentation.
  
  * Postgres docker
  
    `docker run --name postgrestwitter -h postgrestwitter -d isx45128227/postgrestwitter`
  
  * MongoDB docker
  
    `docker run --name mongotwitter -h mongotwitter -d isx45128227/mongotwitter`
